# Tag Filter Feature


## Overview: 
To better allow users filter posts by their relevant tags, without having to navigate to a whole different section 


## Usage
Simply by navigating to the relevant pages with sorting functions, you will find the dropdown menu on the right featuring all the available tags currently in the forum




## Future Plans
An possible future addition is the ability to filter by multiple tags, giving the added flexibility of finding posts with one or more tags, and perhaps improve the granulity of our searches.
